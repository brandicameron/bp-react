My second React project was a bit more sensible and I really got to see where components shine. You can instantly sign in as a guest, [so give it a try](https://brandicameron.github.io/bp-react/)!

## Things Learned:

- I enjoyed figuring out how to make the inputs jump autofocus to the next input when adding readings, which makes the form MUCH nicer to use. There is conditional logic that determines when a jump in focus is needed depending on if the Systolic/Diastolic reading is two digits or three.

- This project was originally built in vanilla javaScript with Firebase 8. There were some big changes with Firebase 9 so it was nice to get to work with it.

- More opportunities to work with useState, useEffect and custom hooks.

- First time incorporating Sass in a react project.

- Was interesting getting the "slide to reveal delete button" on touch devices working smoothly. (the delete button is on hover for desktop)

## To Do:

- Not a lot I'd like to add here, this was intended to be a simple app that does one simple thing, but does it well. I don't feel the need to get fancy with it.
